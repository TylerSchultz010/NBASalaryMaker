The objective of this program is quite simple. User will be able to enter inputs for the anticipated contract (in millions), the amount of years, and lastly the contract rate. Using the contract rate, the program will appropriately aggregate the contract year by year through a series of calculations, ultimately displaying what the theoretical contract would look like based on the parameters.

This program should be mostly useful for other NBA nerds who care about contracts and stuff.
